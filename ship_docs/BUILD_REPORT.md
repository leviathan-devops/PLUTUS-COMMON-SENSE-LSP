# BUILD_REPORT — PLUTUS-COMMON-SENSE-LSP (the what-was-built record)

**Date:** 2026-09-29 · **The repo:** PLUTUS-COMMON-SENSE-LSP (own .git) · **The commits (HEAD at the audit):** a1d4342 + the audit's follow-ups; the earlier: f4b9260, 5154527, 8260183 (audit F13: the record named a stale prefix)

## §1 · WHAT WAS BUILT (the deliverable)
A third custom LSP server, `plutus-lsp`, that makes the Plutus knowledge graphs REFLEXIVE:
on every write/edit to a Plutus file it reads the graph (L1 semantica + L2 arsumbris), judges
the edit via JevK5 (CH-PLUTUS, the 5-of-7 nouls), and surfaces the governing law as an LSP
diagnostic — before the agent can derail. It INFORMS; it never blocks (the polarity law).

## §2 · THE FILES (the deployed set)
| the file | the role | the lines |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/plutus-lsp.ts` | the stdio JSON-RPC server + --selftest + the receipt | 168 (measured, audit F8) |
| `src/plutus-lsp/store.ts` | the graph reader (L1 kg.json + L2 socket) + the named refusals | 266 (measured) |
| `src/plutus-lsp/judge.ts` | CH-PLUTUS (the 7 nouls) + OBSERVABLE + the verdict | 207 (measured) |
| `src/plutus-lsp/cards.ts` | the 7 tokens + FactCard + toDiagnostic | 166 (measured) |
| `tests/*.test.ts` | the W1/W2/W3 gates + the 8-angle adversarial sweep | ~180 |
| `tests/calibration/*` | the labeled corpus + the derivation harness | ~90 |
| `~/.omp/agent/lsp.json` | the registration (beside gi-lsp + jg-lsp) | 1 entry |

## §3 · THE VERIFICATION (every tier, with its artifact)
| tier | what | the artifact |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | the typecheck | `bun test` loads + runs (the TS is executed, not just parsed) |
| L1 | the unit | `bun test tests/` → **18 pass / 0 fail (the audit added test_lsp_selftest_emits_token)** |
| L2 | the script test (the real modules, the real graph, the live judge) | `--selftest mirror.ts` → 2 cards + 5 live nouls |
| L3 | the driven server (the real stdio frames) | `/tmp/plutus-lsp-receipts.log` → `PUBLISH n=3 … verdict=SUSPECT` |
| L4 | the live TUI | **PENDING** — the LSP binds at session construction (T1) |

## §4 · THE CALIBRATION (the derived bar)
`reports/CALIBRATION_v1.md` → **bar 0.30 · F1 0.60 · precision 0.50 · recall 0.75** on the
8-item corpus (4 violations + 4 cleans). Reproducible (`bun tests/calibration/calibrate.ts`).

## §5 · THE DEFECTS FOUND + FIXED (5)
1. the L1 law entities overwritten by the adapter rebuild → re-added (564).
2. health() captured the env at module load → read at call time.
3. the token matcher over-matched on generic words → +STOPWORDS.
4. the calibration's state diluted the signal → +lawsForHunk (ranked, top-3).
5. the generic question required derivation → +OBSERVABLE templates.

## §6 · THE HONEST GAPS
- The live-TUI render proof is PENDING (a session restart is needed).
- The calibration corpus is 8 items (a 50+ corpus stabilizes the bar).
- The `plutus/callers` token is declared but not yet emitted.
- The enforcement extension (the block) is deferred to v2 (D5).

## §7 · THE ROUND-10 FIX BATCH (2026-09-30 · commit 816b384 — the current HEAD)

**THE TRIGGER:** the round-9 audit GATE: FAIL (0 critical, 12 high, findings=31) + the round-10
audit GATE: FAIL (2 critical, 10 high, findings=30). **21 findings closed** across the two rounds.
The round-11 audit is BLOCKED (provider unreachable — `127.0.0.1:4097` connection refused, the
go-session-proxy lane down; NOT a code verdict).

**THE MEASURED STATE AT THIS COMMIT:**
| the file | the lines | the role |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/plutus-lsp.ts` | 350 | the stdio server + the fire-and-forget L2 + the receipt |
| `src/plutus-lsp/store.ts` | 440 | the graph reader + the contiguous L2 framing + the fail-closed tier |
| `src/plutus-lsp/judge.ts` | 421 | the chain on jevk5Fetch + the visible cap + the single threshold source |
| `src/plutus-lsp/cards.ts` | 264 | the finite-only cards + the epsilon attribution + the STALE codes |
| `dist/plutus-lsp.js` | 41,046 bytes · sha256 `51f95e841cf6247f…` | the built bundle (rebuilt at this commit) |

**THE FIXES (per finding, highest severity first):**
1. CRITICAL `knownAbs` undefined (store.ts:119) — `PLUTUS_ALLOW_KNOWN_PATHS=1` threw
   ReferenceError; entries are absolute, `resolve()` normalizes. FIXED.
2. CRITICAL `MAX_STDIN` read-but-never-declared (scripts:261) — ReferenceError on the oversize
   path; declared before the stdin handler. FIXED.
3. HIGH `validTier` fail-open to IMMUTABLE — corrupt tiers outranked canon (+2); now SUPERSEDED
   (-2, fail-closed). FIXED.
4. HIGH L2 framing split-prefix — `chunks[0][0..3]` without contiguity; now concat-once then
   `readUInt32BE(0)`. FIXED.
5. HIGH chain dedupe mismatch (`['P1','P1']` → false JUDGE_ANSWER_COUNT) — loop + count both use
   the validated set; chain now reuses `jevk5Fetch` (the drift source removed). FIXED.
6. HIGH relevance cap invisible — `{ok,scored}` carried no `judged/total/dropped`; now returned
   AND receipted. FIXED.
7. HIGH outer catch published `[]` (wiped last-good diagnostics) — now sends nothing (same as the
   double-fault path). FIXED.
8. HIGH send() dangling `once('drain')/once('error')` per call (MaxListeners + stale done()) —
   the write callback is the only resolver; dead-stream short-circuit. FIXED.
9. HIGH lawCard Infinity-as-measured + per-element null guards; verdictCard epsilon tie + explicit
   kind gate + target-file warning; callersCard deduped-empty→null; STALE codes `[JEVK5_*]` vs
   `[PLUTUS_NO_*]`; fileOf decode-last + UNC; L2 fire-and-forget; health() array rejection;
   single threshold source (consts delegate to getters). ALL FIXED.
10. MEDIUM/LOW — INCONCLUSIVE separator unified, DRIFT clause from the verdict, STOPWORDS private
    + predicate, `export {a as b}` keeps both names, deterministic caller order, timeoutMs
    validation, single-pass tokenization, frozen marker arrays, empty-id laws dropped at load,
    dead guards/consts/ternary removed. ALL FIXED.

**THE VERIFICATION AT THIS COMMIT:**
| tier | what | the artifact |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | the unit | `bun test tests/` → **26 pass / 0 fail / 117 expects** |
| L2 | the live selftest ×4 (the real graph + the LIVE JevK5) | store: 11 cards (10 LAW + 1 SUSPECT) · judge: 13 cards (12 LAW + 1 SUSPECT) · script: 12 cards (11 LAW + 1 SUSPECT) · cards: 13 cards (12 LAW + 1 VIOLATION `MECH-TOKEN-08 P6=0.868`, `YOU ARE EDITING: src/plutus-lsp/cards.ts`) |
| L3 | the built bundle | `dist/plutus-lsp.js` sha256 `51f95e841cf6247f…` (rebuilt, committed) |

**THE HONEST RESIDUAL:** the round-11 audit could not run (provider down — BLOCKED, not PASS);
the 7 remaining medium/low findings from round-10 (chain drift now closed by the jevk5Fetch
refactor; `plutus/tier` documented dead-filter; L2 receipt timing) are recorded, not hidden.
